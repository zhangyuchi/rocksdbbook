# RocksDB Iterator

RocksDB Iterator allows users to iterate over the DB forward and backward in a sorted manner. It also has the ability to seek to a specific key inside the DB, to achieve that .. the Iterator need to access the DB as a sorted stream.
RocksDB Iterator implementation class is named `DBIter`, In this wiki page we will discuss how `DBIter` works and what is it composed of. In the following figure, you can see the design of `DBIter` and what it's composed of.

## DBIter
> Implementation: [db/db_iter.cc](https://github.com/facebook/rocksdb/blob/master/db/db_iter.cc)

> Interface: [Iterator](https://github.com/facebook/rocksdb/blob/master/include/rocksdb/iterator.h)

`DBIter` is a wrapper around an `InternalItertor` (In this case a `MergingIterator`).
`DBIter`'s job is to parse InternalKeys exposed by the underlying `InternalIterator` and expose them as user keys.

##### Example:
The underlying `InternalIterator` exposed
```
InternalKey(user_key="Key1", seqno=10, Type=Put)    | Value = "KEY1_VAL2"
InternalKey(user_key="Key1", seqno=9,  Type=Put)    | Value = "KEY1_VAL1"
InternalKey(user_key="Key2", seqno=16, Type=Put)    | Value = "KEY2_VAL2"
InternalKey(user_key="Key2", seqno=15, Type=Delete) | Value = "KEY2_VAL1"
InternalKey(user_key="Key3", seqno=7,  Type=Delete) | Value = "KEY3_VAL1"
InternalKey(user_key="Key4", seqno=5,  Type=Put)    | Value = "KEY4_VAL1"
```

But what `DBIter` will expose to the user is
```
Key="Key1"  | Value = "KEY1_VAL2"
Key="Key2"  | Value = "KEY2_VAL2"
Key="Key4"  | Value = "KEY4_VAL1"
```
## MergingIterator
> Implementation: [table/merger.h](https://github.com/facebook/rocksdb/blob/master/table/merger.h)

> Interface: [InternalIterator](https://github.com/facebook/rocksdb/blob/master/table/internal_iterator.h)

The `MergingIterator` is composed of many child iterators, MergingIterator is basically a heap for Iterators.
In `MergingIterator` we put all child Iterators in a heap and expose them as one sorted stream.
##### Example:
The underlying child Iterators exposed
```
= Child Iterator 1 =
InternalKey(user_key="Key1", seqno=10, Type=Put)    | Value = "KEY1_VAL2"

= Child Iterator 2 =
InternalKey(user_key="Key1", seqno=9,  Type=Put)    | Value = "KEY1_VAL1"
InternalKey(user_key="Key2", seqno=15, Type=Delete) | Value = "KEY2_VAL1"
InternalKey(user_key="Key4", seqno=5,  Type=Put)    | Value = "KEY4_VAL1"

= Child Iterator 3 =
InternalKey(user_key="Key2", seqno=16, Type=Put)    | Value = "KEY2_VAL2"
InternalKey(user_key="Key3", seqno=7,  Type=Delete) | Value = "KEY3_VAL1"
```

The `MergingIterator` will keep all child Iterators in a heap and expose them as one sorted stream
```
InternalKey(user_key="Key1", seqno=10, Type=Put)    | Value = "KEY1_VAL2"
InternalKey(user_key="Key1", seqno=9,  Type=Put)    | Value = "KEY1_VAL1"
InternalKey(user_key="Key2", seqno=16, Type=Put)    | Value = "KEY2_VAL2"
InternalKey(user_key="Key2", seqno=15, Type=Delete) | Value = "KEY2_VAL1"
InternalKey(user_key="Key3", seqno=7,  Type=Delete) | Value = "KEY3_VAL1"
InternalKey(user_key="Key4", seqno=5,  Type=Put)    | Value = "KEY4_VAL1"
```

## MemtableIterator
> Implementation: [db/memtable.cc](https://github.com/facebook/rocksdb/blob/master/db/memtable.cc)

> Interface: [InternalIterator](https://github.com/facebook/rocksdb/blob/master/table/internal_iterator.h)

This is a wrapper around `MemtableRep::Iterator`, Every memtable representation implement it's own Iterator to expose the keys/values in the memtable as a sorted stream

## BlockIter
> Implementation: [table/block.h](https://github.com/facebook/rocksdb/blob/master/table/block.h)

> Interface: [InternalIterator](https://github.com/facebook/rocksdb/blob/master/table/internal_iterator.h)


This Iterator is used to read blocks from SST file, whether these blocks were index blocks or data blocks.
Since SST file blocks are sorted and immutable, we load the block in memory and create a `BlockIter` for this sorted data.

## TwoLevelIterator
> Implementation: [table/two_level_iterator.cc](https://github.com/facebook/rocksdb/blob/master/table/two_level_iterator.cc)

> Interface: [InternalIterator](https://github.com/facebook/rocksdb/blob/master/table/internal_iterator.h)

A `TwoLevelIterator` is composed of 2 Iterators
* First level Iterator (`first_level_iter_`)
* Second level Iterator (`second_level_iter_`)

`first_level_iter_` is used to figure out the `second_level_iter_` to use, and `second_level_iter_` points to the actual data that we are reading.
##### Example:
RocksDB uses `TwoLevelIterator` to read SST files, `first_level_iter_` is a `BlockIter` on the SST file Index block and `second_level_iter_` is a `BlockIter` on a Data block.

Let's look at this simplified representation of an SST file, we have 4 Data blocks and 1 Index Block
```
[Data block, offset: 0x0000]
KEY1  | VALUE1
KEY2  | VALUE2
KEY3  | VALUE3

[Data Block, offset: 0x0100]
KEY4  | VALUE4
KEY7  | VALUE7

[Data Block, offset: 0x0250]
KEY8  | VALUE8
KEY9  | VALUE9

[Data Block, offset: 0x0350]
KEY11 | VALUE11
KEY15 | VALUE15

[Index Block, offset: 0x0500]
KEY3  | 0x0000
KEY7  | 0x0100
KEY9  | 0x0250
KEY15 | 0x0500
```

To read this file we will create a `TwoLevelIterator` with 
* `first_level_iter_`  => `BlockIter` over Index block
* `second_level_iter_` => `BlockIter` over Data block that will be determined by `first_level_iter_`

When we ask our `TwoLevelIterator` to Seek to `KEY8` for example, It will first use `first_level_iter_` (BlockIter over Index block) to figure out which block may contain this key. this will lead us to set the `second_level_iter_` to be (BlockIter over data block with offset `0x0250`). We will then use the `second_level_iter_` to find our key & value in the data block.
